	<h3>OnlAud [Online Auditions]</h3>
	<p><h4><u>Vision</u></h4>
	OnlAud seeks to promote job specialization in Zimbabwe's entertainment industry
	through exhibiting the work of those artists who are not multi-talented. We realised that the current crop of artists
	are muti-talented and are therefore carrying out jobs which actually require more than one person.
	
	Job specialization bring onboard those artists who previously could not showcase their talents as doing 
	so currently requires one to ensemble a band and is difficult if not impossible if one is not multi-talented.
	We envision an entertainment industry in which, for example,  songwriters can be hired solely for their ability to write good lyrics
	and likewise dancers or vocalists must be able to make a living from their expertise as not all artists can be multi-talented.	
	</p>
	<p><h4><u>Case Studies</u></h4>
	The late Tongai Moyo is an example of a songwriter-cum-singer who is believed to have been forced to start a band because no artist could
	accept his lyrics. Artists prefer to write their own songs, a situation which is not ideal 
	as artists sometimes rush to finish up music albums without enough meaninful songs. Tongai Moyo is said to have tried to make the 
	late Leornard Dembo perfom some of his songs but in vain and he had to start his own band. The same scenario occured on the imternational scene
	however this time with deadly consequences. The story of the group Millli Vanilli reminds us of how desperate some producers can be
	in trying to come up with an artist who is endowed with many gifts. This sounds ridiculous
	but is the fact of what artists can encoumter in the entertainment field.

	<p><h4><u>Objective</u></h4>
	OnlAud will be conducting video auditions online. Participants who are considered as talented by our panel
	of online judges can exhibit their work on the OnlAud website as well as link collaborate with other registered users.
	OnlAud will in the future try to partner with  established talent shows  in the Southern African Region and afford its users
	a chance to perfom to a wider audience to gain the much needed exposure.
